      <h2>GET TO KNOW ME WELL</h2>

      <p style= text-align:justify> My name is Puteri Edrina Balqis, but most people call me Dina. I am a student from Terengganu who is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Systems Management at UiTM Machang. I am passionate about learning and always looking for ways to improve myself. I have a strong interest in technology and creativity, and I also love sports. I can play many types of sports such as netball, volleyball, hockey, badminton, and table tennis but netball is the one I’m best at. I am the fourth child out of five siblings. I enjoy eating spicy food and I’m not really a fan of sweet things like chocolate. One of my personal challenges is my fear of animals, due to past trauma, I find it difficult to be around them. I also don’t like crowded places, as they make me feel uncomfortable and easily irritated. During my leisure time, I enjoy watching movies and K-dramas. I can watch almost all genres, but my favorite is romantic comedy (rom-com), especially in K-dramas. The only genre I really don’t enjoy is horror, mainly because I dislike jump scares and the scary faces of ghosts. I also love singing, it’s one of the ways I express myself and relax. My ambition is to become a data analyst in the banking industry. I would describe myself as an independent person, but sometimes I feel shy when talking to others but, I’m strugle to improve it by joining a lot of programme. One of my strengths is that I’m good at organizing things and learning new skills quickly. This website is a small reflection of who I am and what I’m learning along the way. I am able to work in a team, supported by my experience working at McDonald's and an optical store. Additionally, during my school years, I was part of the dormitory representative council, where I gained valuable experience and learned many new things. These experiences have made me comfortable and well-versed in working collaboratively with others.
